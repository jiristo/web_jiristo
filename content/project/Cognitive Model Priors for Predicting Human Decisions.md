title: Cognitive Model Priors for Predicting Human Decisions | AISC
summary: The work elaborates on previous attempts to outperform cognitive models developed by social scientists by ML algorithms. The authors use the BEAST model to create a synthetic dataset and internalize its weight in a neural network. Unlike previous attempts, the model can work only on raw data without exhaustive feature engineering and achieve unseen performance.
