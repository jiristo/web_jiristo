I am going for AWS because of its popularity (motivation: industry expectation). I regret it... I lost all my day while trying to figure out everything. I closed AWS documentation and opened Deep Learning. I sweared I will read the entire book chapter by chapter. Application is what does matter but first I need to build on a solid "skeleton", i.e. theory. I learned about different distribution functions and their application. E.g. mass and marginal distribution functions.
