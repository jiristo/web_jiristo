I am geting back to DataCamp. I've figured out that following relevant tracks (e.g. DL for now) with combination of reading articles and watching videos is one of the most effective learning paths when the starting point and direction are unknown. I also connected and had a call with two other data scientist. Daniel's from Ottawa, has a PhD in Computer Sciences. It turned out he knows the same folks in Toronto, mostly through following AISC. He knows Amir and Toronto ML Channel on Slack. On top of that, he is an expert in DL. So great connection! Diven is Omar's apprentice as I am. He works on the same recsys utilizing Surprise and is moving to Toronto soon. We agreed on some strategy how to start building DL recsys together. Finally, I bought the ticket for reinforcement learning workshop. Reinforcement deep learning recommender system?! Hell, I am going for that!
