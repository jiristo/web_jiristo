Called with Omar yesterday. He will finish editing my post about matrix factorization recommender system in a week. I really need to publish it. It's been already three months from my last post. Definitely, I will follow up with smth. regarding DL. There is good repository on Wikipedia: **List of datasets for machine-learning research**. Now it's time to focus on "Deep Learning based Recommender System: A Survey and New Perspectives" by Zhang et al.
Wikipedia: RNN (recurrent neural network) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[1] or speech recognition. Such network has over-performed standard recsys. I more and more think I should focus on techniques to build a recommender system based on DL and RL.
