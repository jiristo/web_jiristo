Recently, I was working on a project while using bagging tree-based algorithms for low-frequency time-series data. Originally, the data set contained only three variables for each series. However, given the nature of time-series data stored in the wide formar, I succeeded in engineeing 300 more features. 
The presentation was first introduced during an online session organized by the Aggregate Intelect Socratic Circles (#AISC) https://aisc.ai.science/
