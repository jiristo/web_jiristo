      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a data scientist and research associate with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Applied Economics. Consequently, I am passionate about technology and data that generate economic value. Currently, I work on deep learning based recommender systems with A.I. Socratic Circles (AISC) research team. I solve business problems through the broad-based application of data science and creativity. For example, I co-developed a launch sequence (genetic algorithm) for innovative drugs. The solution helps a European pharmaceutic company to maximize product revenue by 17%.&lt;/p&gt;
