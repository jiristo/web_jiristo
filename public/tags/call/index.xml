      <description>&lt;p&gt;Called with a colleague, Mirek. Mirek uses Azur, he showed me to run it. Pretty simple compared to AWS. Anyway, Mirek has built a TS model (with ARIMAX) predicting gold price. He is trying to challange his model with DL; specifically LSTM. We discussed parameters like batch size and number of samples. Quite exciting! I&amp;rsquo;ve once  read the best performance on TS data is usually achieved with combination of TS and DL models. On top of that, Mirek shared with me Bokeh library for dashboards. He says it&amp;rsquo;s simpler than Pyviz. I need to give it a try&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
